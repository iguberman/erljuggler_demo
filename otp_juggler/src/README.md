**The purpose of this entire section to provide the skeleton for 
killer_juggler DEMO rewrite
as an OTP application**

This is an excercise!  
FORK this repo and implement on your own!

Have fun! 


Most of the code here was generated by 
1. `rebar3 new app otp_juggler_app`
2. IntelliJ Erlang plugin OTP behavior templates -- hence all the nice
dialyzer specs that they come with!   
 
Basic supervision tree and the gen_servers 
have been identified but not implemented.
